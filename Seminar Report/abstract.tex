	\indent \textbf{\textit{iHalo}} is a personal home automation assistant that would help us to control our electrical
home appliances with ease, integrated with augmented reality and intended for the common
public and also for the visually challenged and speech-impaired persons. Itâ€™s acts as an
artificial intelligence which can be controlled using voice command (given by user). You can
give the command to switch on or off the devices (like light, fan etc) as well as you can even
manipulate them like fan speed, light intensity. Commands are sent via a Wi-Fi module to the
Arduino Board. So there is no need for you to get up to switch on or switch off the device
while watching a movie or doing some important work. Our project  \textbf{\textit{iHalo}}, also provides an
health monitoring service to the residents in our home specifically could also be used to
monitor the health conditions of the old people/patients in our home.
